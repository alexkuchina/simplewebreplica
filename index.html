			<h1>Italian Cuisine</h1>
			<p>It is easy to love good food, and we Italians know a couple of things about it. When you enjoy cooking, you become acquainted with ingredients and flavors with a pleasurable delight; you get to know how they mix with each other, which type of scent their fragrance produce and how they will taste once they touch your tongue. Ah... food: like poetry and painting, it's impossible to resist the beauty in forms and colors it creates when it's spread out on a table and, of course, it's even harder to refrain from tasting it.</p>
			<p>When you love food, there are two things you really want to do: eat it and make it. That's why it's nice to have a well furnished kitchen, and plenty of interesting recipes to try, as well as a gang of good friends to invite over to justify your spending every single weekend surrounded by pots and pans, making your best impression of a domestic goddess/god. But you know what, there's something we barely stop thinking about when in the kitchen, the history behind what we're making and eating. Have you ever thought of it? You guys, on the other side of the pond, are usually more aware of it, as your cuisine is a delicious melting pot of flavors and cultures hailing from every corner of the Earth, the heritage and history of which is usually well rooted into the community.</p>
			<p>In Italy, things are a bit different: we usually care deeply and lovingly about our family's cooking history: grandmas and moms' recipes are passed on with care and pride, a symbol itself of one's own heritage and roots. Some of us are more aware than others of regional characteristics typical of each dish, but it is not usual, when it comes to the kitchen, to look further back than a couple of generations: our knowledge of why we cook in a certain way and why we eat certain things is normally based on oral sources (our elders) and therefore have a limited timespan.</p>
			<p>The history of Italian cuisine, however, is as long and rich as the country's history itself, its origins laying deep into the ancenstral history of Rome, its people and its political, cultural and social power. Italian cuisine has evolved and changed following the evolution and the changes of Italy itself throughout centuries of wars, cultural mutations and contacts: it's a history as rich, colorful and fascinating as the most amazing of recipes.</p>
